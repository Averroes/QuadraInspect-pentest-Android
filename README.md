The security of mobile devices has become a critical concern due to the increasing amount of sensitive data being stored on them. With the rise of Android OS as the most popular mobile platform, the need for effective tools to assess its security has also increased. In response to this need, a new Android framework has emerged that combines three powerful tools - AndroPass, APKUtil, and MobFS - to conduct comprehensive vulnerability analysis of Android applications.

AndroPass is a tool that focuses on analyzing the security of Android applications' authentication and authorization mechanisms. It can perform a detailed analysis of an application's source code, identifying any potential weaknesses in the app's authentication and authorization protocols. APKUtil, on the other hand, is a tool that extracts valuable information from an APK file, including the application's manifest, resources, and source code. It can be used to analyze an app's behavior, including its network activity and the permissions it requests.

Lastly, MobFS is a tool that facilitates the analysis of an application's filesystem by mounting its storage in a virtual environment. This tool can be particularly useful when examining sensitive data stored by an application, such as login credentials or personal information.

By combining these three tools, the Android framework provides a comprehensive approach to vulnerability analysis of Android applications. This framework can be used by developers, security researchers, and penetration testers to assess the security of their own or third-party applications. Ultimately, this framework aims to increase the security of Android applications and protect users' sensitive data from potential threats.
